Experiment 1
Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice 
files to use during this lab. In each set, replace X with the 
numbers 1 through 6. Create six files with names of the 
form songX.mp3, snapX.jpg, filmX.avi. Create three 
subdirectories for organizing your files, and name the 
subdirectories friends, family, and work. Use a single 
command to create all three subdirectories at the same 
time.
