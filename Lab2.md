Experiment 2:
View the gedit man page. 
Use the man -k ext4 command to find the command to 
tune ext4 file-system parameters. 
Brace expansion is used to generate discretionary strings 
of characters. Braces contain a comma-separated list of 
strings, or a sequence expression. The result includes the 
text that precedes or follows the brace definition. 
Implementation:
man gedit
